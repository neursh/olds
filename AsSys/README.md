# AsSys
Back in 2020, when covid started, I started to actually learn programming due to boredom. One search on YouTube leads me to a bunch of tutorials that is 2 to 5 hours of watch time. I ain't gonna watch allat.

So instead, I jump straight into making my own thing, my very own project, no guidance, no videos, just do.

And I've managed to make this one, a console assistant with a bunch of ifs.

And if you ask: "Why there are so many files?". I did what most kids do, tryna make things bigger than it usually is. I copy some files from the python `Libs` folder to make it more "serious", claiming I did allat

So the only two files that I made is:
- `Launch.py` and `Data/AsSys.py`

The files that responsible for storing 2 infos are `Data/data001.pi` and `Data/data002.pi`. If `data002.pi` is `false`, you'll have to wait the dummy loading screen, veri col, and `data001.pi` is for storing your name.

If any of the data files are not inside `Data`, or `data002.pi` is empty, the thing just dies.

No modification made since 25/10/2020, but this is public, so for privacy reasons, I will delete some of the code that contains outright stupid things like plain text password or doxxing my own place.

Assumming the user is having dementia, I like that!

I once even tried to make it so that I can publish it on FaceBook group for people to try my thing and giving feedback, and you know what, I'll spill the beans, the two games are fake, I'm trying to impress NO ONE ðŸ¥€:

So after making it for a while, I think that people should be able to do this thing too! So there's a `Learn Python` command:

hoh?

Ohhh, I have to type the thing with no uppercase for some reason:

This is really cute tho:

It ends at page 2 :(

There are SOOOOO many thing to explore inside this thing, about 80 ifs, idk, most of them are handling different kinds of uppercase letters.

To keep things interesting, I'll commit using web upload, I didn't know `git`, back when I created this account, and I thought it's just a place to store code, thinking why people upload code to this one and not Google Drive ðŸ”¥.

This thing is filled with bad practices and overall unusable code. But that's the fun of it, imagine if gen ai is available back then, i'll abuse the hell out of it instead of learning anything, i'm not that kind of an easy to lock in person. welp, have fun looking around!

And remember, there are no shortcuts to knowledge, except keep learning, unless you have wizard that puts everything inside your brain.
